This is a free software. You should however contact
me if you want to change the program.

Designs 2 is a program that displays various types of
designs. It is quite easy to use the program. Just
use side arrow keys to goto previous or next choice,
enter key to select, and escape key to exit.

Designs 2 requires EMS, so if the program does not
work, then activate the EMS. EMS can be activated
in the following way:

Right Click > Properties > Memory > EMS > Set to Auto
Also additionally, set XMS to Auto

That's all. If you have any better designs please mail
them to me. I will wait for them.
